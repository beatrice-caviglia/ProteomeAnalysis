# Github Repository for MD Proteome Analysis

This repository contains 
1) A Python Class "Proteome": designed to analyse MD simulations of crowded (protein) systems.
2) Main analysis scripts: These scripts were used in the article "Cytoplasmic Fluidity and the Cold Life: ProteomeStability is Decoupled from Viability in Psychrophiles".
   They utilize the Proteome class to perform analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on crowded protein systems from three bacterial species: P. arcticus, E. coli and A. aeolicus.

### Installation and Usage:
To install the Proteome Class and analysis scripts clone or download the repository:

git clone https://github.com/beatrice-caviglia/ProteomeAnalysis.git  
cd Proteome_Analysis  

### Usage:
The Analysis scripts can be tested with the published data available at the following Zenodo link:   
Scripts are provided as Jupyter Notebooks or .py files.  
Adjust paths in scripts according to downloading path. Further details on scripts are provided in the Scripts_Analysis_PA_EC_AA folder.   
A tutorial for the Proteome Class is under construction and will be made available as soon as possible.
